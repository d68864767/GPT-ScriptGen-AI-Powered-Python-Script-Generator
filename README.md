# GPT-ScriptGen: AI-Powered Python Script Generator

## Project Introduction and Purpose

GPT-ScriptGen is a Python script that utilizes GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology to generate Python scripts based on user-defined criteria and inputs. This tool aims to provide developers with a powerful resource for quickly generating Python scripts tailored to their specific needs and requirements, boosting productivity and automating repetitive coding tasks.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guide with Examples

To use GPT-ScriptGen, run the `GPT_ScriptGen.py` script. You will be prompted to enter the type of script you want to generate, the purpose of the script, and the parameters for the script. You can also customize the generated script by specifying variables and function names.

Example:

```python
python GPT_ScriptGen.py
```

## Supported Script Types and Purposes

GPT-ScriptGen can generate a wide variety of Python scripts based on the user's input. The type, purpose, and parameters of the script are all defined by the user.

## Customization Options

Users can customize the generated scripts by specifying variables and function names. This allows for greater flexibility and control over the output.

## How GPT-ScriptGen Works

GPT-ScriptGen uses OpenAI's GPT API for natural language processing and script generation. The user's input is used as a prompt for the GPT model, which then generates a Python script based on the prompt. The generated script can be further customized by the user.

## Acknowledgments and Credits

This project uses the OpenAI GPT API for script generation.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! Please submit a pull request with your proposed changes.

## License Information

This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the `LICENSE` file for more details.

## Testing and Validation

The `test_GPT_ScriptGen.py` script contains unit tests for the GPT_ScriptGen class. To run the tests, use the following command:

```python
python -m unittest test_GPT_ScriptGen.py
```

## Security Measures

The `security.py` script contains functions for encrypting and decrypting the API key used to access the GPT API. The API key is stored as an environment variable and encrypted using the Fernet symmetric encryption method.

## Error Handling

GPT-ScriptGen includes error-handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected issues during script generation.

## Documentation and Comments

The code for GPT-ScriptGen is well-documented and includes comments to explain the functionality of each part of the script.

## Continuous Improvement

We plan to make ongoing improvements and updates to GPT-ScriptGen to expand the range of supported script types and enhance code quality.

## User Feedback

We encourage users to provide feedback on the quality and usefulness of the AI-generated scripts. Please submit your feedback as an issue on the project's GitHub page.
